Artificial intelligence for music composers - ORB COMPOSER
 Orb without a daw (stand alone) Orb works directly with your favorite VST/AU instruments Each instrument and articulation can be directly connected to your VST/AU instruments, allowing a 100% stand-alone usage of Orb Composer, without any DAW connection. It is useful for drafting, experimenting, and making an instant music creation with a light setup. Orb Composer also provides audio export features and can be connected later to a DAW in the same project. All the instruments are editable directly inside Orb Composer as you would do inside a DAW. A complete mapping tool is provided to sync all instruments and articulations within your DAW if you want to use your DAW.
