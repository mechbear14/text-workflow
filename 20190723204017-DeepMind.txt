DeepMind
Shakir grew up in Johannesburg, South Africa, and initially pursued a degree in electrical and information engineering before becoming intrigued by the principles of learning systems and moving onto graduate study at Cambridge University and the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) exploring Neural Computation and Adaptive Perception. He then joined DeepMind as a Research Scientist, exploring the fundamentals of imagination, reasoning, and future thinking without the need for external signals. He loves working at DeepMind because of its unique environment that embraces and encourages different approaches to machine learning, and relishes the opportunity to regularly think about the ways in which machine learning and AI can be used to truly overcome the challenges facing humanity.
