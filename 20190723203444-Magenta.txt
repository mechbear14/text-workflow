Magenta

What is Magenta?
An open source research project exploring the role of machine
      learning as a tool in the creative process.



Python

Magenta is distributed as an open source Python library, powered by
        TensorFlow. This library includes utilities
        for manipulating source data (primarily music and images), using this data to train
        machine learning models, and finally generating new content from these models.
      


JavaScript
Magenta.js is an open source JavaScript API for using the pre-trained Magenta
        models in the browser. It is built with TensorFlow.js,
        which allows for fast, GPU-accelerated inference. If you're interested in seeing how
        Magenta models have been used in existing applications or want to
        build your own, this is probably the place to start!
